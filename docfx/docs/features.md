# Features

* Report tests as skipped instead of as pass or fail when the inputs, the operating system, or other factors render the test invalid or not applicable.
* A test result can be "Skipped" based on a runtime check within the test, an attribute on the test method, or a throwing one or more particular exceptions.
* Support for skipping facts or individual test cases in theories.
* Optionally provide the reason for a test being skipped for inclusion in the test log.
